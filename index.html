            "<b>Far off in the frozen north and the wind swept cliffs of Iceland</b>, A poet writes and tells the tales 
             of his homeland and it's people. A land as <b>harsh</b> and <b>unforgiving</b> as its people whose earth freezes over 
             in the winter and whose sun would hide for months. He writes of <b>kings</b> and <b>jarls</b> stories of <b>Dan</b> 
             and <b>Offa</b> brothers from the family of <b>Rig</b> also known as the all seeing god <b>Heimdall</b>. Offa became 
             the father of the <b>Angels</b> an ancient people who would conquer the <b>free sea</b> and the province of
             <b>Britannia</b>. Dan would become the father of the <b>Dani</b> in <b>Scannia</b>. Soon, everyone all around them 
             will know their homeland, as the land of the <b>Danes</b>."

                If there was one thing Denmarks history is known for it would be <b>Vikings</b>! The viking tribes of scandinavia 
                and the germanic tribes of what is now modern day France and Germany can trace its origins back to Denmark. The 
                penninsula having been settled by early indoeuropean peoples creating seafaring communities which based their way 
                on life on fishing and sailing. Scandivania's harsh conditions had made it so its peoples had needed to rely on 
                raiding neighboring communities to survive, breeding a warrior culture which will become what we now know as the 
                 vikings. During the great viking age, as viking kings began to amass wealth from raiding their neighbours 
                they had began to carve up chunks of land for themselves within England, France and more forming the Danelaw. 
                Back home, Denmark had begun to unite into one unified kingdom, with the first historically recognised king being 
                Gorm the Old who turned the city of Roskilde into its capital, with the area of Scania (south of modern day Sweden)
                 the Danish islands and Julland. It is said that the current royal family of Denmark can trace their lineage back
                 to Grom the Old making the Dannish monarchy the oldest in Europe.

                With the end of the Viking Age and the spread of chrsitianity, Denmark would become the leading crusading state 
                in the Baltic sea. With blessing from the pope they lead a crusade against the pagan tribes of Livonia under
                 King Valdemar II. It is said on the year 1219 at the Battle of Lindanise, the cross had fell from heaven in the
                 shape of the Dannebrog, giving the Danes the courage to win the battle. With the Dannebrog becoming the worlds
                 oldest national flag still in use today.
